# Omakub

Initial fork of Omakub, to retrofit it into a develeap project.
It will still be an opinionated overall installer and configuration manager that is
designed to be used on top of an existing Ubuntu installation,
HOWEVER
there will be a significant amount of changes to the original project,
including the shift to Nix, first where PPAs and non apt packages were/are currently used.

Longterm goal with the Nix shift is to make it outstanding and composable, such that
it would be possible to use it on top of any Linux installation, regardless of the usage 
of other parts of this project.


Following sections are the original README.md from the Omakub project.
